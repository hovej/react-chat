This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

React Chat is a web app built for users to message each other inside a chat room.
It is built entirely in ReactJS and uses a Firebase Real-time database for data storage.

You can try it out yourself at https://hovej.github.io/react-chat
